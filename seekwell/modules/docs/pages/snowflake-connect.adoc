== Use your existing JDBC connection string

You can re-use an existing JDBC connection string to connect to Snowflake.

For example, consider the following connection string:

[source]
----
jdbc:snowflake://xy12345.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com/?user=peter&warehouse=mywh&db=mydb&schema=public
----

Here are the values you can use:

[horizontal]
Account Name:: xy12345
Region:: eu-central-1 (if this is missing, it means you're in us-west-1)
Username:: peter
Warehouse:: mywh
Database:: mydb
Schema:: public
