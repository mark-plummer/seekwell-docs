[#first-snippet]
== Creating your first snippet

To create a snippet, use the following combination of keys:

[tabset]
====
MacOS::
+
--
*Command* + *k* → *Create snippet*
--
PC::
+
--
*CTRL* + *k* → *Create snippet*
--
====

A good use of snippets in SeekWell is for date formats.

Example:: We use the following snippet to create three date formats based on a `timestamp`:
+
[source]
----
date_trunc('day', {{column_name}})::date as "{{alias}}_day",

date_trunc('week', {{column_name}})::date as "{{alias}}_week",

date_trunc('month', {{column_name}})::date as "{{alias}}_month"
----
+

After you type double curly brackets, `{{`, SeekWell adds the variable to *Defaults*. Defaults is a good container for commonly used variables, such as `created_on`.

NOTE: Variables are optional. If you don't use variables in your snippet, you have a *static snippet*.
